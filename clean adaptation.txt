Consider separating the UI and infrastructure layers into separate projects to increase their independence and maintainability.

Ensure that your dependencies flow in the correct direction, from the outer layers to the innermost layers.

Consider using dependency injection to manage dependencies and make your code more testable and flexible.

Ensure that you have clear boundaries between your layers to avoid coupling and maintain code readability.

Consider adding unit tests to ensure that each layer and component of your project works correctly and independently.
